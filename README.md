# PortfolioSamples
A couple samples from my latest project in Unreal Engine called Encore, a multiplayer 5v5 ability-based tactical shooter based on Valorant.

* **[Sample 1](https://github.com/JustinAHelmer/PortfolioSamples/tree/main/Sample%201%20-%20Game%20Instance)** conatins the game instance sample which handles multiplayer networking, like creating sessions and joining sessions.

There is also a folder which contains an Unreal Engine plugin I am developing as a result of my project. It is a gameplay and editor plugin intended to create a "Character Pool" that allows you to easily manage characters within your game, with features such as enabling, disabling, and getting all available character classes during runtime with the help of Gameplay Features.

Unreal Engine **[Blueprint Portfolio](https://blueprintue.com/profile/justinahelmer/)**: Contains samples of **blueprint scripting** from my work.

Link to my **[ArtStation](https://www.artstation.com/justinahelmer/albums/10574415)**, which contains **ability examples** and **level design**.
