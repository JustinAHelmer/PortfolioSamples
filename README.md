# PortfolioSamples
A couple samples from my latest project in Unreal Engine called Encore, a multiplayer 5v5 ability-based tactical shooter based on Valorant.

* **[Sample 1](https://github.com/JustinAHelmer/PortfolioSamples/tree/main/Sample%201%20-%20Game%20Instance)** - Game Instance handling multiplayer networking, like creating sessions and joining sessions.

* **[Sample 2](https://github.com/JustinAHelmer/PortfolioSamples/tree/main/Sample%202%20-%20Game%20Mode)** - Game Mode setting default Player Controller, Pawn, and HUD classes.

* **[Sample 3](https://github.com/JustinAHelmer/PortfolioSamples/tree/main/Sample%203%20-%20HUD%20Parent%20Class)** - HUD Parent Class instantiating loading screen functionality. Further implementation in Blueprint.

* **[Sample 4](https://github.com/JustinAHelmer/PortfolioSamples/tree/main/Sample%204%20-%20Character%20Pool%20Plugin%20(WIP))** - Unreal Engine Gameplay & Editor Plugin (WIP). Intended to create a "Character Pool" for easy management of characters within your game. Features intended: Register characters to the pool in editor, enable, disable, and get all available character classes during runtime with the help of Gameplay Features.
