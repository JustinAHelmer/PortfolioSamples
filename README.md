# PortfolioSamples
This Repo contains a couple code samples from my latest project in Unreal Engine.
This project called Encore is a Multiplayer 5v5 ability-based tactical shooter based on Valorant.

There is also a folder which contains an Unreal Engine plugin I am developing as a result of my project. The plugin is intended to create a "Character Pool" that allows you to easily manage characters within your game, with features such as enabling, disabling, and getting all available character classes during runtime with the help of Gameplay Features.

Unreal Engine **[Blueprint Portfolio](https://blueprintue.com/profile/justinhelmer/)**: Contains samples of **blueprint scripting** from my work.

Link to my **[ArtStation](https://www.artstation.com/jrocks22)**, which contains **ability examples** and **level design**.
